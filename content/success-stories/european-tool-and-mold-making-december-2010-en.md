summary: "The use of industrial robots to automate such shop-floor tasks as debugging, trimming, polishing and welding, and also for performing rapid prototyping, machining and waterjet cutting with a single part setup, is becoming increasingly common and popular. Until recently, however, the lack of available good programming solutions for robots was a limitation for manufacturers wanting to adopt robot technology for shop-floor, rather than production-line tasks. That changed when Jabez Technologies developed Robotmaster CAD/CAM software, now distributed within the European market by Intercam S.A."
